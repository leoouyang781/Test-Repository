    "In Chapter 6, Capital Asset Pricing Model, we discussed the simplest one-factor linear\n",
    "model: CAPM. As mentioned, this one-factor linear model serve as a benchmark for\n",
    "more advanced and complex models. In this chapter, we will focus on the famous\n",
    "Fama-French three-factor model, Fama-French-Carhart four-factor model, and\n",
    "Fama-French five-factor model. After understanding those models, readers should\n",
    "be able to develop their own multifactor linear models, such as by adding Gross\n",
    "Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), a business cycle indicator\n",
    "or other variables as an extra factor(s). In addition, we will discuss performance\n",
    "measures, such as the Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, and Jensen's alpha. In particular,\n",
